## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I select a tank?**
A: Enter the tank ID (e.g., "F12", "A1") in the search field, or tap "Tanques" to browse the complete list of 153 available tanks.

**Q: What do the tank specifications mean?**
- **Galones/Pulgada:** Gallons per inch in the cylindrical body
- **Galones en Tope:** Total gallons in the conical top (campana)
- **Pulgadas en Tope:** Height of the conical top section
- **Galones Totales:** Total tank capacity

### Calculations

**Q: How do I calculate wine volume from space measurement?**
1. Select your tank
2. Choose "Espacio → Galones" mode
3. Enter the inches of empty space measured from the top
4. Tap "CALCULAR"

**Q: How do I find the required space for a specific volume?**
1. Select your tank
2. Choose "Galones → Espacio" mode
3. Enter the desired gallons
4. Tap "CALCULAR"

**Q: What does the precision message mean?**
- **"Cálculo en cuerpo cilíndrico - Precisión: 99.9%"**: Your measurement is in the cylindrical body section, which provides the highest accuracy.
- **"¡Ya está en la campana, primo! Precisión: ~97.99%"**: Your measurement is in the conical top section. The calculation uses a calibrated formula but has slightly lower precision due to the cone shape.

**Q: Why are there different precision levels?**
The cylindrical body section has a constant gallons-per-inch ratio, making calculations very precise. The conical top (campana) has a variable ratio that we've calibrated with a special formula based on 5 years of field experience.
